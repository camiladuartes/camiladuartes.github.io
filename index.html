                <p>
                    My name is Camila Duarte, I am 20 years old, and I am graduating in Information Technology at UFRN(Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte), with an emphasis on Computer Science. My main interest has been in the area of Software Development, and I am really into data structures, algorithms implementation and problem solving. My favorite programming languages are C++ and Python, and some of my skills are:

                            Helped refactor a part-of-speech tagger (POS tagger) system for the Portuguese language with the use of word embeddings representation and Pytorch library;<br>
                            Helped build a system to visualize the POS embeddings data, which are the distributed representation of words at the grammatical class level, with the t-SNE technique, so we could have an intuition of how the data is organized in a high-dimensional space.

                            Helped develop an object detection system with MobileNet (model trained with the Tensorflow Object Detection API) and YOLOv3-Tiny aiming at greater automation and efficiency in the work performed by the Federal Highway Police;<br>
                            Acquired some experience in native development for mobile devices using Java to add intelligence to the application, using Tensorflow API and OpenCV library.
