                <p>
                    My name is Camila Duarte, I am 20 years old, and I am graduating in Computer Science at UFRN(Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte). My main interest has been in the area of Artificial Intelligence, and I am really into data structures and algorithms implementation. My favorite programming languages are C++ and Python, and some of my skills are:

                            Helped refactor a part-of-speech tagger (POS tagger) system for the Portuguese language with the use of word embeddings representation and Pytorch library;<br>
                            Helped build a system to visualize the POS embeddings data, which are the distributed representation of words at the grammatical class level, with the t-SNE technique, so we could have an intuition of how the data is organized in a high-dimensional space.
